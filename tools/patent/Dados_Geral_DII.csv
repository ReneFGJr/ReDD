The concentration of the anesthetics shall compose approximately 0.5-10% of the composition.    TECHNOLOGY FOCUS - POLYMERS - Preferred Components: The polymers used for production of the nanoparticles are selected from poly ( epsilon -caprolactone), copolymers of methacrylate acid and methacrylate or acrylic esters, poly(alkyl methacrylate), poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(lactide), poly(lactide-glycolide), poly(glycolide), poly(caprolactone), poly(amides), poly(anhydrides), poly(amino acids), poly(esters), poly(cyanoacrylates), poly(phosphazines), poly(phosphoesters), poly(esteramides), poly(dioxanones), poly(acetals), poly(cetals), poly(carbonates), poly(orthocarbonates), degradable poly(urethanes), chitins, chitosans, poly(hydroxybutyrates), poly(hydroxyvalerates), poly(maleic acid), poly(alkyleneoxalates), poly(alkylenesuccinates), poly(hydroxybutyrates-co-hydroxyvalerates), and copolymers, terpolymers, oxidized cellulose, or their combinations or mixtures. ACTIVITY - Anesthetic. Test details are described but no results given.    MECHANISM OF ACTION - None given.    ADMINISTRATION - The anesthetic composition is administered topically to the skin or mucosa (claimed). No dosage details given.    EXAMPLE - Organic phase was prepared by dissolving the polymer (poly epsilon -caprolactone) , Eudragit S100 (RTM: methyl polymethacryllate) (1.0), and the mixture of active agents lidocaine (in g) (2.5) and prilocaine (2.5) in acetone. The phase was maintained under agitation and moderate heat (30-40 degrees C), until complete dissolution of the components. The aqueous phase was prepared in a separate beaker and consisted of the tensoactive (Tween 80 (RTM: polysorbate 80)) (1) dispersed in water. After complete dissolution of the components, the organic phase was slowly poured through a funnel over the aqueous phase, under moderate agitation at ambient temperature and then maintained under agitation for a further 10 minutes. The suspension was then concentrated in a rotary evaporator at a pressure of 3-6 bar and water bath temperature of 40-45 degrees C, until attaining a final volume of approximately 100 mL, to form a suspension. ;;"A96 (Medical, dental, veterinary, cosmetic.);  B07 (General - tablets, dispensers, catheters (excluding drainage and angioplasty), encapsulation etc, but not systems for administration of blood or saline or IV feeding etc.)";"A12-V01;  A12-W14;  B04-C02A1;  B04-C02E3;  B04-C03;  B07-D05;  B10-B01A;  B10-B02A;  B10-B02F;  B10-B04B;  B10-C04C;  B14-C08";"A61K-031/166;  A61K-031/167;  A61K-047/30;  A61K-047/48;  A61K-009/51;  A61P-023/02;  A61K-009/14;  A61K-047/32;  A61K-047/34;  A61K-047/36;  A61K-047/38;  A61K-031/16;  A61K-009/50";"WO2008113144-A1   25 Sep 2008   A61K-031/166   200874Pages: 32   English;  BR200700832-A   04 Nov 2008   A61K-009/51   200876   ;  EP2134334-A1   23 Dec 2009   A61K-031/166   201001   English;  US2010086614-A1   08 Apr 2010   A61K-009/14   201025   English;  MX2009009853-A1   28 Feb 2010   A61K-031/166   201032   Spanish;  JP2010521498-W   24 Jun 2010   A61K-047/34   201041Pages: 18   Japanese;  US8568788-B2   29 Oct 2013   A61K-009/50   201372   English;  JP5496684-B2   21 May 2014   A61K-047/34   201434Pages: 13   Japanese;  MX322732-B   11 Aug 2014   A61K-031/166   201475   Spanish";"WO2008113144-A1    WOBR000070    12 Mar 2008;   BR200700832-A    BR000832    16 Mar 2007;   EP2134334-A1    EP714517    12 Mar 2008;   US2010086614-A1    US531404    15 Sep 2009;   MX2009009853-A1    MX009853    14 Sep 2009;   JP2010521498-W    JP553872    12 Mar 2008;   US8568788-B2    US531404    15 Sep 2009;   JP5496684-B2    JP553872    12 Mar 2008;   MX322732-B    MX009853    14 Sep 2009";"EP2134334-A1 PCT application Application WOBR000070;   EP2134334-A1 Based on Patent WO2008113144;   US2010086614-A1 PCT application Application WOBR000070;   MX2009009853-A1 PCT application Application WOBR000070;   MX2009009853-A1 Based on Patent WO2008113144;   JP2010521498-W PCT application Application WOBR000070;   JP2010521498-W Based on Patent WO2008113144;   US8568788-B2 PCT application Application WOBR000070;   US8568788-B2 Based on Patent WO2008113144;   JP5496684-B2 PCT application Application WOBR000070;   JP5496684-B2 Based on Patent WO2008113144;   JP5496684-B2 Previous Publ.

USE - The nanocapsules or nanospheres optionally contain drugs such as diclofenac (claimed). The obtained dry products are typically used in the production of pharmaceutical dosage forms such as capsules, tablets, granules or powders for oral administration. Typically diclofenac is incorporated in nanocapsules or nanospheres to improve the redispersiblity in water, modify the plasma level profile with respect to time and reduce the gastrointestinal toxicity after oral adminstration.    ADVANTAGE - The physico-chemical stability of the system is improved sufficiently to allow spray-drying, which is cheaper, gives a powder of better defined grain size and is more suitable for industrial use than lyophilization. Spray-drying involves only brief exposure of the suspension to heat, and is thus appliable to heat-sensitive products. Other properties of the system are retained or even improved. The dried products have improved stability. ;EXAMPLE - None given. ;;"B07 (General - tablets, dispensers, catheters (excluding drainage and angioplasty), encapsulation etc, but not systems for administration of blood or saline or IV feeding etc.);  B05 (Other organics - aromatics, aliphatic, organo-metallics, compounds whose substituents vary such that they would be classified in several of B01 - B05.)";"B04-C03;  B05-B02C;  B10-B02E;  B12-M11B;  B12-M11C;  B12-M11D;  B12-M11G";"A61K-009/51;  A61K-031/196;  B01J-002/06;  B01J-013/04;  C08J-003/12";"FR2801227-A1   25 May 2001   B01J-013/04   200142Pages: 9;  BR9906081-A   26 Jun 2001   C08J-003/12   200145";"FR2801227-A1    FR015084    22 Nov 2000;   BR9906081-A    BR006081    22 Nov 1999";;BR006081    22 Nov 1999;;;"FR2801227-A1 -- JP3278830-A   AGENCY OF IND SCI & TECHNOLOGY (AGEN);  US3576759-A   NAT CASH REGISTER CO (NATC);  US4489017-A   BAYER AG (FARB)   ALBERTS H,  DAHM M,  JABS G,  WEGNER C";"FR2801227-A1  DATABASE WPI Section Ch, Week 199204 Derwent Publications Ltd., London, GB; Class B07, AN 1992-030443 XP002200720 &amp; JP 03 278830 A (AGENCY OF IND SCI &amp; TECHNOLOGY), 10 d cembre 1991 (1991-12-10);  DATABASE WPI Section Ch, Week 199204 Derwent Publications Ltd., London, GB; Class B07, AN 1992-030443 XP002200720 &amp; JP 03 278830 A (AGENCY OF IND SCI &amp; TECHNOLOGY), 10 dcembre 1991 (1991-12-10)";"184613-0-0-0 K M; 12641-0-0-0 K M; 107016-0-0-0 K M U";;;"RA00I9 K M; R03008 K M; R06850 K M; R01694 K M";1694-U

One of the derived networks for value is selected as the derived, potential network of the value of function and switch network for each of the multiple values of the function. Selected networks are derived by different methods.    USE - For deriving switch network.    ADVANTAGE - Optimized network is obtained by simply selecting the optimal pull-up network and optimal pull-down network independently of the method used for generating the network through deriving of large number of pull-up networks and large number of pull-down networks and finally determining which pull-up network and which pull-down network to use. Larger portions of circuit are feasible as single cells by arriving at true minimum number of serial transistors, thus produces speed improvements and area and power savings due to the use of smaller number of cells.    DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are the following:    (1) a method of determining the lowest number of serial switches in a switch network representing the value of Boolean function;    (2) a method of mapping a Boolean function or a network of switches;    (3) a method of improving a network or Boolean function;    (4) a computer program adapted to control a processor; and    (5) a circuit or gate.

USE - For preparation of halogen-free ionic liquids (claimed) useful as lubricating agent between metallic parts that undergo higher level of mechanical wear.    ADVANTAGE - The process is simple and quick; and uses only two stages that sequential or not. The anion metathesis procedures generates a great variety of ionic liquids based on 1,3-dialkylimidazolium of good quality. The reaction of N-alkylimidazol with alkyl sulfonates, at room temperature, favors the production of 1,3-dialkylimidazolium alkane-sulfonates as crystalline solids at high yields. The alkane-sulfonate anions are easily substituted by a series of other anions through simple anion, salt, or acid reactions in water at room temperature. The extraction with dichloromethane, filtration, and evaporation of the solvent, allows the production of the desired ionic liquids at yield of 80-95%. The purity of these ionic liquids is greater than 99.4%. ";TECHNOLOGY FOCUS - ORGANIC CHEMISTRY - Preferred Method: The determination of the purity of the ionic liquids is obtained using the intensity of 13C satellites of the N-methyl group of the nucleus of imidazolium of the product as a standard in the spectrum of the hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance as an internal standard. EXAMPLE - Butyl methanesulfonate (45.60 g) was mixed with 1-methyl imidazolium (24.60 g) and the reaction mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature (25degrees C) for 48 hours. After this period of time, acetone and one 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium methanesulfonate crystal were added, to induce the crystallization of the product. The mixture was kept in the refrigerator overnight. A yellow, supernatant solution was decanted from the almost colorless crystals and the crystallization process was again repeated. After drying under vacuum, colorless 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium methane-sulfonate (BMI.CH3SO3) crystals were obtained. A mixture formed by BMI.CH3SO3 (10.6 g), sodium tetrafluoroborate (6 g) and water (5.4 ml) was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. The resulting mixture, made up of two phases, was extracted with dichloromethane (3x 15 ml). The combined organic extract was dried with anhydrous sodium carbonate and the solvent was evaporated under vacuum and heated (80degrees C), which produced 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium (C1-C18)trifluoroborate (BMI.BF4) ionic liquid (yield 92%). ;;"E13 (Heterocyclics.);  H07 (Lubricants and lubrication - this excludes self-lubricating surfaces e.g. PTFE coated surfaces and lubrication systems in general.

USE - For preparation of halogen-free ionic liquids (claimed) useful as lubricating agent between metallic parts that undergo higher level of mechanical wear.    ADVANTAGE - The process is simple and quick; and uses only two stages that sequential or not. The anion metathesis procedures generates a great variety of ionic liquids based on 1,3-dialkylimidazolium of good quality. The reaction of N-alkylimidazol with alkyl sulfonates, at room temperature, favors the production of 1,3-dialkylimidazolium alkane-sulfonates as crystalline solids at high yields. The alkane-sulfonate anions are easily substituted by a series of other anions through simple anion, salt, or acid reactions in water at room temperature. The extraction with dichloromethane, filtration, and evaporation of the solvent, allows the production of the desired ionic liquids at yield of 80-95%. The purity of these ionic liquids is greater than 99.4%. ";TECHNOLOGY FOCUS - ORGANIC CHEMISTRY - Preferred Method: The determination of the purity of the ionic liquids is obtained using the intensity of 13C satellites of the N-methyl group of the nucleus of imidazolium of the product as a standard in the spectrum of the hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance as an internal standard. EXAMPLE - Butyl methanesulfonate (45.60 g) was mixed with 1-methyl imidazolium (24.60 g) and the reaction mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature (25degrees C) for 48 hours. After this period of time, acetone and one 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium methanesulfonate crystal were added, to induce the crystallization of the product. The mixture was kept in the refrigerator overnight. A yellow, supernatant solution was decanted from the almost colorless crystals and the crystallization process was again repeated. After drying under vacuum, colorless 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium methane-sulfonate (BMI.CH3SO3) crystals were obtained. A mixture formed by BMI.CH3SO3 (10.6 g), sodium tetrafluoroborate (6 g) and water (5.4 ml) was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. The resulting mixture, made up of two phases, was extracted with dichloromethane (3x 15 ml). The combined organic extract was dried with anhydrous sodium carbonate and the solvent was evaporated under vacuum and heated (80degrees C), which produced 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium (C1-C18)trifluoroborate (BMI.BF4) ionic liquid (yield 92%). ;;"E13 (Heterocyclics.);  H07 (Lubricants and lubrication - this excludes self-lubricating surfaces e.g. PTFE coated surfaces and lubrication systems in general.

Preferred Condition: The ionic liquid is 1-20% v/v in relation to the co-solvent. EXAMPLE - Tetraethoxysiloxane (10 ml) was placed in a beaker fitted with a magnetic stirrer and heated at 60 degrees C. Nanoparticles of rhodium (10 mg) were redispersed in BMI.BF4 (undefined) (1 ml) ionic liquid. Ethanol (5 ml) was added to the solution comprising the ionic liquid and nanoparticles, subjected to ultrasound for 2 minutes and added to the beaker containing the tetraethoxysiloxane. An acid solution containing water (2 ml) and hydrofluoric acid (5 ml) was added. The mixture was initially homogenized by gentle magnetic stirring (10 minutes), followed by application of ultrasound (2 minutes) and allowed to stand in a semi-sealed beaker at 60 degrees C for 18 hours. The resulting material (rhodium nanoparticles supported on silica matrix) was washed with acetone several times, dried under vacuum and used in a catalytic process. The extraction with acetone may be used to remove the liquid. Calcination at 450 degrees C for 6 hours can also be used to extract the ionic liquid. The distribution of rhodium particles on the silica matrix was found to be relatively homogeneous by chemical mapping. The average size of the rhodium nanoparticles immobilized on the silica was 4.1 plus minus 0.6 nm. ;;"J04 (Chemical/physical processes/apparatus - including catalysis, catalysts (excluding specific e.g. enzymatic or polymerisation catalysts), colloid chemistry, laboratory apparatus and methods, testing, controlling, general encapsulation, detection and sampling (excluding clinical testing) (B01J, L).);  L03 (Electro-(in)organic - chemical features of conductors, resistors, magnets, capacitors and switches, electric discharge lamps, semiconductor and other materials, batteries, accumulators and thermoelectric devices, including fuel cells, magnetic recording media, radiation emission devices, liquid crystals and basic electric elements.

USE - Method of preparing supported catalyst comprising noble metal nanoparticles (claimed) useful as catalysts, fuel cells, supercapacitors, and components for batteries.    ADVANTAGE - The method produces supported catalysts through sol-gel process in a single stage, which are quite homogeneous, have a regular distribution of noble metal nanoparticles in the solid matrix, and have greater catalytic activity than isolated noble metal nanoparticles. ";TECHNOLOGY FOCUS - INORGANIC CHEMISTRY - Preferred Component: The noble metal comprises iron, ruthenium, osmium, cobalt, rhodium, iridium, nickel, platinum, or palladium (preferably rhodium). The anion comprises potassium hexafluoride or boron tetrafluoride. The catalyst for the sol-gel process is an inorganic acid or a base. Preferred Compound: The inorganic acid comprises hydrofluoric acid or hydrochloric acid. The base is ammonium hydroxide. Preferred Condition: The noble metal nanoparticles in the supported catalyst have a concentration of 0.10-0.15% (m/m) and a mean size of 3-6 nm.    TECHNOLOGY FOCUS - ORGANIC CHEMISTRY - Preferred Component: The ionic liquid is a derivative of 1-3-dialkylimidazolium cation associated with a weakly coordinating anion. The co-solvent is alcohol. The molecular precursor is an alkoxide, particularly a metal alkoxide. The metal alkoxide is an alkoxysiloxane. The anion may also comprise trifluoromethane sulfonate or trifluoromethane sulfonyl imide. Preferred Compound: The alcohol is ethanol. The alkoxysiloxane is tetraethoxysiloxane. Preferred Condition: The ionic liquid is 1-20% v/v in relation to the co-solvent. EXAMPLE - Tetraethoxysiloxane (10 ml) was placed in a beaker fitted with a magnetic stirrer and heated at 60 degrees C. Nanoparticles of rhodium (10 mg) were redispersed in BMI.BF4 (undefined) (1 ml) ionic liquid. Ethanol (5 ml) was added to the solution comprising the ionic liquid and nanoparticles, subjected to ultrasound for 2 minutes and added to the beaker containing the tetraethoxysiloxane. An acid solution containing water (2 ml) and hydrofluoric acid (5 ml) was added. The mixture was initially homogenized by gentle magnetic stirring (10 minutes), followed by application of ultrasound (2 minutes) and allowed to stand in a semi-sealed beaker at 60 degrees C for 18 hours. The resulting material (rhodium nanoparticles supported on silica matrix) was washed with acetone several times, dried under vacuum and used in a catalytic process. The extraction with acetone may be used to remove the liquid. Calcination at 450 degrees C for 6 hours can also be used to extract the ionic liquid. The distribution of rhodium particles on the silica matrix was found to be relatively homogeneous by chemical mapping.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for nanocomposites prepared with the above process.    DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING(S) - The figure shows a flowchart of preparing nanocomposite. ";"TECHNOLOGY FOCUS - ORGANIC CHEMISTRY - Preferred Components: The organophilic clay is phyllosilicate superficially modified with an organic tensoactive. The solvent is volatile polar organic solvent, e.g. ketone, aldehyde, alcohol, ester, ether, amine, organo-halogenated compound, and/or substance containing at least two of these chemical functions. The solvent is 3-8C ketone and/or ester, preferably propanone, methyl-ethyl-ketone, methyl-isobutyl-ketone, ethyl acetate, and/or butyl acetate. The oil is mineral oil.Preferred Properties: The oil has a viscosity of 20-600 (preferably 100-200) cPs. The oil initial solidification temperature is lower than room temperature.    TECHNOLOGY FOCUS - POLYMERS - Preferred Components: The polymer is polyolefin, polar copolymer, elastomer, polyester, polystyrene, or acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). The polyolefin is polyethylene and its copolymer, or polypropylene and its copolymer. Preferred Process: The polymer may be mixed to anti-oxidizing and/or compatibilizer agent with shaking. Shaking is performed in vigorous conditions. The process may include solvent removal step, and heating, mixing and solvent removal steps are performed in an extruder. Polymer is supplied to the initial part of the extruder where melting occurs, the emulsion is introduced in the homogenization zone, and the solvent is removed in the extruder degassing zone. Alternatively, preparation of nanocomposite includes combining and mixing polymer, organophilic clay, solvent and oil components in an extruder to form a composite material in which the organophilic clay is dispersed throughout the polymer; removing solvent from the composite material; and advancing the nanocomposite mixture out of the extruder to form a nanocomposite material. The polymer is heated to its melting point prior to the combining step.Preferred Amounts: The amount of organophilic clay used in preparing the emulsion is 0.2-10 (preferably 0.5-7) wt.%, based on the total weight of final nanocomposite. The solvent is used at 2-30 g/ g clay. The amount of oil used in preparing the emulsion is 0.2-12 (preferably 0.5-6) wt.% compared to the total weight of nanocomposite. The compatibilizer agent is used at 0-30 (preferably 0-15) wt.%, based on the total weight of nanocomposite. EXAMPLE - Propylene homopolymer (94%) was added in the solids dosimeter of extruder. Separately, an emulsion was prepared at 25degreesC by adding methyl ethyl ketone to Cloisite 15A(RTM: organophilic clay) (5%) to make clay swelled, adding polypropylene glycol (1%), and stirring for 15 minutes. The emulsion and homopolymer were processed in a reactive co-rotating twin screw extruder. After the extrusion, the material was pelletized. The nanocomposite had fluidity rate of 4.3 g/10 minutes, flexular modulus of 2580 MPa, flow stress of 36 MPa, flow elongation of 8.2%, elongation at break of 114%, Izod impact of 111 J/m at 23degreesC, and heat deflection temperature of 113.

The concentration of the anesthetics shall compose approximately 0.5-10% of the composition.    TECHNOLOGY FOCUS - POLYMERS - Preferred Components: The polymers used for production of the nanoparticles are selected from poly ( epsilon -caprolactone), copolymers of methacrylate acid and methacrylate or acrylic esters, poly(alkyl methacrylate), poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(lactide), poly(lactide-glycolide), poly(glycolide), poly(caprolactone), poly(amides), poly(anhydrides), poly(amino acids), poly(esters), poly(cyanoacrylates), poly(phosphazines), poly(phosphoesters), poly(esteramides), poly(dioxanones), poly(acetals), poly(cetals), poly(carbonates), poly(orthocarbonates), degradable poly(urethanes), chitins, chitosans, poly(hydroxybutyrates), poly(hydroxyvalerates), poly(maleic acid), poly(alkyleneoxalates), poly(alkylenesuccinates), poly(hydroxybutyrates-co-hydroxyvalerates), and copolymers, terpolymers, oxidized cellulose, or their combinations or mixtures. ACTIVITY - Anesthetic. Test details are described but no results given.    MECHANISM OF ACTION - None given.    ADMINISTRATION - The anesthetic composition is administered topically to the skin or mucosa (claimed). No dosage details given.    EXAMPLE - Organic phase was prepared by dissolving the polymer (poly epsilon -caprolactone) , Eudragit S100 (RTM: methyl polymethacryllate) (1.0), and the mixture of active agents lidocaine (in g) (2.5) and prilocaine (2.5) in acetone. The phase was maintained under agitation and moderate heat (30-40 degrees C), until complete dissolution of the components. The aqueous phase was prepared in a separate beaker and consisted of the tensoactive (Tween 80 (RTM: polysorbate 80)) (1) dispersed in water. After complete dissolution of the components, the organic phase was slowly poured through a funnel over the aqueous phase, under moderate agitation at ambient temperature and then maintained under agitation for a further 10 minutes. The suspension was then concentrated in a rotary evaporator at a pressure of 3-6 bar and water bath temperature of 40-45 degrees C, until attaining a final volume of approximately 100 mL, to form a suspension. ;;"A96 (Medical, dental, veterinary, cosmetic.);  B07 (General - tablets, dispensers, catheters (excluding drainage and angioplasty), encapsulation etc, but not systems for administration of blood or saline or IV feeding etc.)";"A12-V01;  A12-W14;  B04-C02A1;  B04-C02E3;  B04-C03;  B07-D05;  B10-B01A;  B10-B02A;  B10-B02F;  B10-B04B;  B10-C04C;  B14-C08";"A61K-031/166;  A61K-031/167;  A61K-047/30;  A61K-047/48;  A61K-009/51;  A61P-023/02;  A61K-009/14;  A61K-047/32;  A61K-047/34;  A61K-047/36;  A61K-047/38;  A61K-031/16;  A61K-009/50;  A61K-009/00;  A61K-009/06";"WO2008113144-A1   25 Sep 2008   A61K-031/166   200874Pages: 32   English;  BR200700832-A   04 Nov 2008   A61K-009/51   200876   ;  EP2134334-A1   23 Dec 2009   A61K-031/166   201001   English;  US2010086614-A1   08 Apr 2010   A61K-009/14   201025   English;  MX2009009853-A1   28 Feb 2010   A61K-031/166   201032   Spanish;  JP2010521498-W   24 Jun 2010   A61K-047/34   201041Pages: 18   Japanese;  US8568788-B2   29 Oct 2013   A61K-009/50   201372   English;  JP5496684-B2   21 May 2014   A61K-047/34   201434Pages: 13   Japanese;  MX322732-B   11 Aug 2014   A61K-031/166   201475   Spanish;  EP2134334-A4   24 Apr 2013   A61K-031/166   201771   English";"WO2008113144-A1    WOBR000070    12 Mar 2008;   BR200700832-A    BR000832    16 Mar 2007;   EP2134334-A1    EP714517    12 Mar 2008;   US2010086614-A1    US531404    15 Sep 2009;   MX2009009853-A1    MX009853    14 Sep 2009;   JP2010521498-W    JP553872    12 Mar 2008;   US8568788-B2    US531404    15 Sep 2009;   JP5496684-B2    JP553872    12 Mar 2008;   MX322732-B    MX009853    14 Sep 2009;   EP2134334-A4    EP714517    12 Mar 2008";"EP2134334-A1 PCT application Application WOBR000070;   EP2134334-A1 Based on Patent WO2008113144;   US2010086614-A1 PCT application Application WOBR000070;   MX2009009853-A1 PCT application Application WOBR000070;   MX2009009853-A1 Based on Patent WO2008113144;   JP2010521498-W PCT application Application WOBR000070;   JP2010521498-W Based on Patent WO2008113144;   US8568788-B2 PCT application Application WOBR000070;   US8568788-B2 Based on Patent WO2008113144;   JP5496684-B2 PCT application Application WOBR000070;   JP5496684-B2 Based on Patent WO2008113144;   JP5496684-B2 Previous Publ.

USE - The nanocapsules or nanospheres optionally contain drugs such as diclofenac (claimed). The obtained dry products are typically used in the production of pharmaceutical dosage forms such as capsules, tablets, granules or powders for oral administration. Typically diclofenac is incorporated in nanocapsules or nanospheres to improve the redispersiblity in water, modify the plasma level profile with respect to time and reduce the gastrointestinal toxicity after oral adminstration.    ADVANTAGE - The physico-chemical stability of the system is improved sufficiently to allow spray-drying, which is cheaper, gives a powder of better defined grain size and is more suitable for industrial use than lyophilization. Spray-drying involves only brief exposure of the suspension to heat, and is thus appliable to heat-sensitive products. Other properties of the system are retained or even improved. The dried products have improved stability. ;EXAMPLE - None given. ;;"B07 (General - tablets, dispensers, catheters (excluding drainage and angioplasty), encapsulation etc, but not systems for administration of blood or saline or IV feeding etc.);  B05 (Other organics - aromatics, aliphatic, organo-metallics, compounds whose substituents vary such that they would be classified in several of B01 - B05.)";"B04-C03;  B05-B02C;  B10-B02E;  B12-M11B;  B12-M11C;  B12-M11D;  B12-M11G";"A61K-009/51;  A61K-031/196;  B01J-002/06;  B01J-013/04;  C08J-003/12";"FR2801227-A1   25 May 2001   B01J-013/04   200142Pages: 9;  BR9906081-A   26 Jun 2001   C08J-003/12   200145";"FR2801227-A1    FR015084    22 Nov 2000;   BR9906081-A    BR006081    22 Nov 1999";;BR006081    22 Nov 1999;;;"FR2801227-A1 -- JP3278830-A   AGENCY OF IND SCI & TECHNOLOGY (AGEN);  US3576759-A   NAT CASH REGISTER CO (NATC);  US4489017-A   BAYER AG (FARB)   ALBERTS H,  DAHM M,  JABS G,  WEGNER C";"FR2801227-A1  DATABASE WPI Section Ch, Week 199204 Derwent Publications Ltd., London, GB; Class B07, AN 1992-030443 XP002200720 &amp; JP 03 278830 A (AGENCY OF IND SCI &amp; TECHNOLOGY), 10 d cembre 1991 (1991-12-10);  DATABASE WPI Section Ch, Week 199204 Derwent Publications Ltd., London, GB; Class B07, AN 1992-030443 XP002200720 &amp; JP 03 278830 A (AGENCY OF IND SCI &amp; TECHNOLOGY), 10 dcembre 1991 (1991-12-10)";"184613-0-0-0 K M; 12641-0-0-0 K M; 107016-0-0-0 K M U";;;;1694-U
